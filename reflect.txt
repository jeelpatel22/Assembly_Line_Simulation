Initially, the project felt overwhelming, but breaking it down into smaller steps made it feel more manageable, almost like piecing together a Lego set. This approach really enhanced the whole experience, and I'm proud to say I got it working. It's pretty exciting to see how applying what we've learned lets us build something so cool. Using Vector has been a game-changer in making coding easier, and the algorithm library is a fantastic resource. I'm gaining so much knowledge and genuinely enjoying this class.What's more is that doing workshops helps us a lot to improve our thinking abilities and it also helped me in this project as well which I think is more beneficial for me in the  future.
